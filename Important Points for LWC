Decorators:
  @track: to track the changes from JS to HTML reactively(instantly)
  @api: to pass value from parent component to child component and from child to parent component
  @wire: To Expose Apex Method to LWC, the component must be "static" and "global" or "public". Annotate the method with @AuraEnabled.
    To use @wire to call an apex method, you must set "cacheable=true".
To call an apex method, a LWC can:
  a. wire a property
  b. wire a function: call this inside LWC js: import methodName from '@salesforce/apex/className.methodName';
  c. call a method imperatively
  lightning-datatable: 
  1. A table that displays rows and columns of data, this component displays data in tabular format where each column can be displayed based on the data type.
  2. This component inherits styling/css from "data tables" in the lightning design system.
  3. lightning-datatable not supported on mobile device.

To create single record: We can use "lightning-record-form" or using JavaScriptAPI createRecord().
  * Create a single lightning record using "lightning-record-form".
  * Use "ShowToastEvent" to toast message
  * Use "NavigationMixin" to navigate to the particular record or anywhere and add extends NavigationMixin(LightningElement) in the class.
  * Create single record using JavaScript API, call createRecord() method and import createRecord() from the lightning/uiRecordAPI module.
  *  Record Creation with Apex from LWC: Used to create single/multiple records at a time
  
  * Communication between components(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.events):
    A. Components are related and which are under same DOM tree:
    1. Parent to child: Use public properties of child component and can define this property use @api decorator.
    2. Child to parent: Use Custom event --> using cunstructor which needs event name and data to be passed(using detail property).
    B. Components which are not related and which are under different DOM tree, isolatd components:
    1. Using pub-sub module(https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.events_pubsub)
    2. Lightning message channel
